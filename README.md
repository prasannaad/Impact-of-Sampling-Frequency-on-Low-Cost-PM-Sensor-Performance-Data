Data from the Impact of Sampling Frequency on Low-Cost PM Sensor Performance experiment


This data has been collected and studied to understand the sampling frequency of low-cost particulate matter sensors. This study explores how variations in sampling frequency influence the performance of low-cost PM sensors and identifies some possible use cases for different sampling rates. During this study conducted over a one month period, data from five SPS30 sensors was collected at 15 second intervals and then aggregated into 5, 10, 15, 30 and 60 minutes intervals. The device hosting 5 SPS30 sensors was custom built and collocaated with a Beta Attenuation Monitor (BAM) model 1020.
